MIS 543 Online - Project 2 - Reliable Transport Protocol

In this folder you'll find the sample receiver, code for computing and
validating checksums, as well as example sender code.

Quick! What do I have to write?
===============================
Sender.py is the file in which you will implement your reliable sender. You do
not need to modify any other included files to complete this project. Sender.py 
provides all the scaffolding you need to handle the command line arguments we 
will use in the grading of your project.

The Receiver
============
Receiver.py is the sample receiver. The version of Receiver.py here is largely
identical to what we will use for grading your projects (what we actually use
may include additional instrumentation to assist in grading, but should not vary
significantly in functionality). Feel free to learn from it.

BasicSender and Sender
=======================
The BasicSender class in BasicSender.py provides a skeleton upon which to build
your reliable sender. It provides the following methods:

    __init__(self,dest,port,filename): Creates a BasicSender. Specify the
        destination's hostname, the port at which the receiver is listening,
        and a filename to transmit. If no filename is provided, it will read
        from STDIN.

    receive(self, timeout): Receive a packet. Waits for a packet before
        returning. Optionally you can specify a maximum timeout to wait for a
        packet. Returns the received packet as a string, or None if receive
        times out.

    send(self,message): Sends message to the receiver specified when you
        created the sender.

    make_packet(self,msg_type,seqno,message): Creates a BEARDOWN-TP packet from
        the specified message type, sequence number, and message. Generates the
        appropriate checksum, and returns the full BEARDOWN-TP packet with
        checksum appended.

    split_packet(self,packet): Given a BEARDOWN-TP packet, splits a packet into a
        tuple of the form (msg_type, seqno, data, checksum). For packets
        without a data field, the data element will be the empty string. Note that 
        both make_packet and split_packet deal with the message as a string.

In addition, it defines one method which you must implement:

    start(self): Starts the Sender.

We provide starter code in Sender that build upon the BasicSender; you should work
on top of the existing Sender.


Checksums
=========
Checksum.py includes two functions for validating and generating checksums for
your packets:

    validate_checksum(message): Returns true if the message's checksum matches
        the message, and false otherwise. This function assumes the last field
        of the message is the checksum.

    generate_checksum(message): Returns the checksum string for a message. This
        function assumes the message includes the trailing delimiter. The
        checksum is ONLY valid if you simply append this function's result to
        the message you pass in.

Testing
=======
You are expected to write test cases for your own code to ensure compliance
with the project specifications. To assist you, we've given you a simple test
harness (TestHarness.py). The test harness is designed to intercept all packets
sent between your sender and the receiver. It can modify the stream of packets
and check to ensure the stream meets certain conditions. This is very similar
to the grading script that we will use to evaluate your projects.

We have provided three test cases (BasicTest, RandomDropTest, and RandomCorruptTest) 
as examples of how to use the test harness. These test cases send this README file 
using the specified sender implementation to the specified receiver implementation, 
passing all packets through the forwarder unmodified, dropping random packets, or 
corrupting random packets. They both then verify that the file received by the 
receiver matches the input.

To run a test using this test harness, do the following:

    python TestHarness.py -s YourSender.py -r Receiver.py

where "YourSender.py" is the path to your sender implementation, "Receiver.py"
is the path to the receiver implementation. Inside TestHarness.py, you need to
modify the function "tests_to_run" at the top of the script to include any test
cases you add.

Passing the basic test cases we provide is a necessary but not sufficient
condition for doing well on this project; there are still some edge cases that
they do not cover. You should think about what these edge cases might be and 
write appropriate test cases to cover them.

Acknowldgement
==============
This project is based on a project from UC Berkeley CS 168, but with a recent upgrade
to Python 3.
